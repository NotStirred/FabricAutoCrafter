# FabricAutoCrafter
## A Carpet Extension that Adds a New Autocrafter Block

This mod adds a new block, the AutoCrafter. It allows you to put items in the crafting table and get an output. Hoppers and droppers do interact with the table.

*Most of the code belongs to Gnembon. We were going to fork it, but the changes in this mod required a complete restructure of the mod.
Features that differ from Gnembon's mod
- We don't overwrite the crafting table
- Uses Polymer to add a new Crafting Table
- Fixes a item deletion issue
- Fixes a recipe book issue
- Fixes item filters not working
- Adds a recipe for the Auto Crafter

This mod requires Carpet Mod
